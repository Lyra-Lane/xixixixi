# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name: ManYao Li – Personal Resume & Project Showcase Website

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a responsive, bilingual (English & Chinese) personal website hosted on GitHub Pages. The site will showcase resume content, project experience, research outcomes, personal insights, and contact details. It should support long-term maintenance and manual content updates.

---

## 👤 Target Users

* Recruiters and interviewers (to assess candidate background)
* Professors/researchers (to review academic/research work)
* Peers/students (to explore blog posts and open-source projects)

---

## 🧩 Website Structure

### 1. Homepage / Personal Introduction

* Brief self-introduction, including 1–2 profile or activity photos
* Language toggle button (EN / 中文)
* Quick navigation links to other sections

### 2. About Me (Resume Info)

* Educational background, research & internship experience, technical skills, awards
* Full bilingual content on the same page (language switch toggles entire section)

### 3. Projects

* Present individual or team-led projects (research, modeling, competitions, etc.)
* Each project includes: title, timeline, short description, and external links (GitHub, PDF, slides, etc.)
* Categorized by field (e.g., NLP, statistical modeling, AI applications)

### 4. Blog / Insights

* Posts written in Markdown, stored in a GitHub repository
* Website auto-loads and renders these posts
* Support for categories/tags (e.g., technical notes, reflections, competition recaps)

### 5. Contact

* Icons/links for email, LinkedIn, GitHub
* Optional: QR code for WeChat or other contact methods

---

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

* Toggle button for full-site language switching (EN / 中文)
* All static content (bio, resume, project descriptions) will have both language versions
* Implementation: basic static site generator or language toggle component to load different content files

---

## 💾 Content Management

* All content manually maintained via GitHub
* Markdown blog articles hosted in GitHub repo and rendered using tools like Jekyll or Astro
* Images and resume photos also stored in the GitHub repository

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles

* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens
* Clean, professional look with elegant color scheme
* Smooth page transitions and section-based navigation anchors

---

## 🌀 Page Animations and Visual Effects

### Objective

Enhance visual engagement, direct user attention, and convey a sense of professionalism.

### Design Guidelines

Animations should be lightweight and natural, without distracting from the content.

### Recommended Animation Scenarios

1. **Homepage photo and greeting**

   * Style: Fade-in + slight zoom + delayed load
   * Purpose: Create a warm, approachable first impression

2. **Resume sections / project descriptions**

   * Style: Fade-in + upward slide-in (from bottom)
   * Purpose: Reveal content gradually for better readability

3. **Project cards / blog entries**

   * Style: Alternating slide-in (left-right) + subtle hover zoom
   * Purpose: Draw attention to individual blocks, enhance hierarchy

4. **Navbar and language switch button**

   * Style: Short transition effect on interaction (color or scale)
   * Purpose: Clear feedback and refined user interaction

5. **Full-page language or section switch**

   * Style: Fade-out → Fade-in transition
   * Purpose: Smoothly transition between bilingual content or sections

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

* No login or data storage; static-only website
* All contact links are publicly visible and can be periodically reviewed for privacy

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Maintenance

* Site developed using Replit; deployed via GitHub Pages (on `main` or `docs` branch)
* Manual content updates via Git push
* Optional: add GitHub Actions for automated deployment later

---

## 🧱 Recommended High-Level Tech Stack

* Framework: HTML + CSS + JavaScript or Astro (for multilingual static generation)
* Content System: Markdown files in GitHub
* Hosting Platform: GitHub Pages
* Language Switch: Toggle button loads language-specific content files

---

## ⏳ Development Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Website Structure

* Build base layout for all key sections (Home / About / Projects / Blog / Contact)
* Create English and Chinese content files
* Implement language switch mechanism

### Phase 2: Content + Styling

* Add profile photos, project entries, blog framework
* Design theme, color palette, fonts, and layout

### Phase 3: Deployment & Optimization

* Deploy on GitHub Pages
* Add SEO metadata so recruiters can find the site easily
* Simplify update process (optionally add GitHub Actions later)

---

## 🌱 Future Expansion Ideas
